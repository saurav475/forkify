## About
This is a cookbook application that contains recipes for multiple different foods within categories. The user will then select the food he/she likes and the recipe view will be shown with much more details. The user will then be able to add the necessary ingredients to shopping cart (*NOT YET IMPLEMENTED*).

## How to run
__Make sure that Node.js and NPM are installed first by running `node -v` and `npm -v`__
1) Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `npm i`.
2) Prepare for production using `npm run build`.
3) Run with your live server program, in VS Code an extension called Live Server will work
4) Enjoy the app :+1: :)
